# Best Mandhi in Town 🍽️

Bold, flavorful Mandhi picks at your fingertips. This simple site helps you discover great Mandhi spots in your city — no login, just tasty leads.

## Features

## Quick Start
1) Start the restaurant data (backend)

     - Install requirements
     - Start the app

2) Start the website (frontend)
   - Open the `frontend` folder
   - Install dependencies once, then start the site
   - When it’s running, open it in your browser (usually http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:5173)

That’s it. Keep both windows running while you use the site.
